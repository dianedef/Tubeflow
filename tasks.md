# YouTube Clone MVP Tasks

## 1. Define Scope & Features (1-2 days)

## 2. Update Backend (Convex Schema & Functions) (3-5 days)

- [x] Update openai.ts for optional video descriptions (placeholder)

## 3. Update Web App (Next.js) (5-7 days)

- [ ] Add screens: ChannelScreen.tsx, CommentModal.tsx
- [ ] Update Navigation.tsx for video routes

## 5. Shared & Cross-Platform Enhancements (3-5 days)

- [ ] Extend Clerk for channel profiles
- [ ] Adapt search logic to videos
- [ ] Ensure real-time updates for comments/likes
- [ ] Run typecheck/lint across workspaces

## 6. Testing, Polish & Launch (2-3 days)

- [ ] Integration tests: dev run, test playback on web/native
- [ ] Performance optimizations

**Notes**: Focus on front-end UI/UX with placeholders. YouTube API for fetching videos added later. Commit this file after each major update.
